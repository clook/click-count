Xebia subject:
continuous delivery / deployment

basic process:
- master branch = to be deployed
- validation = manual
- CI/CD tool = concourse
- staging = Docker container for staging
- production = Docker container for production

git master release
=> build Docker image
=> deploy latest image to staging (tag image as staging and docker pull)
 => rollback to previous?
=> deploy staging image to production (tag image as production and docker pull)

traefik for proxy

later:
- integration testing (selenium)
- concourse: add permissions and login (teams)
- concourse: add notification (mail / slack...)
- load balancing (service)
- use docker secrets

auto deployment in docker machine:
- install traefik + dns?
- install concourse
- deploy concourse scenar
- initial build to staging + run staging


URL examples:
staging.click-count.xebia-test
click-count.xebia-test
concourse.xebia-test
...

network:
1) traefik front (web frontal proxy)
2) traefik back (any service that could be served by traefik)
3) concourse
...?
